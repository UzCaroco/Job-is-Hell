<h2 align="center"> A group of friends go to an abandoned house at night and try to summon the devil, the ritual goes wrong and they create a portal to hell that sucks them in, but hell is not what it seems, and you fall into a place that looks like a corporation with several demons dressed as employees. Now living in hell, the player must work and bond with demons in order to get out. </h2>
